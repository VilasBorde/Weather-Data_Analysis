Weather Data Analysis:

This is the project uploaded clearly to show how we can perform data analysis on the data we have using PYTHON. However, the data that attached as a CSV file is the weather data that is recorded on hourly basis for a particular region. It records temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure and conditions.

Some of the actions performed on this data using python are--finding unique values from a specified column, grouping all the data by entries in the specified column, counting the instances where the clear weather was recorded, calculating the mean of the visibility and standard deviation of the oerall pressure.
